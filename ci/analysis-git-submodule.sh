# Check that every aff3ct-owned submodule is pinned to a commit that is really
# merged in its own repository.
#
# The CI can fetch a commit that only exists as a pull request head, so a build
# can be perfectly green while the pinned revision lives nowhere durable. Once
# such a revision is merged into aff3ct, a force-push or a branch deletion in
# the submodule repository makes this repository impossible to clone. This
# check is what turns that silent trap into an explicit failure, before the
# merge rather than after it.
#
# Only submodules declared with a relative URL in .gitmodules are checked:
# those resolve against the aff3ct organization. Third-party submodules (e.g.
# lib/date) are skipped, we do not control their branches.
#
# Each submodule is compared against its *own* default branch, as advertised by
# its remote: streampu, conf and refs use 'develop', MIPP and cli use 'master'.
# Do not assume the branch name matches the one being built here.
